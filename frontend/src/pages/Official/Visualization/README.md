🗺️ Visualization Map - Documentation
🚀 Overview

The Visualization Map in ResQWave displays all occupied terminals in real time. Each terminal is represented by a colored pin based on its current status or alert type.

🎨 Pin Colors
Color	Hex	Meaning
🔴 Red	#ef4444	Critical – Triggered by sensors
🟡 Yellow	#eab308	User-Initiated Alert
🟢 Green	#22c55e	Online – No alert
⚪ Gray	#6b7280	Offline – No alert

⚠️ Note: Alert type overrides terminal status.
If alertType is NULL, the system displays the Online/Offline state.

🗺️ ResQWave Visualization Map - User Story
Overview
The Visualization Map provides real-time emergency monitoring and rescue dispatch management for dispatchers and administrators.

📍 User Story Flow
1. Real-Time Map Visualization
As a dispatcher, I want to see live emergency alerts on a map so I can monitor all terminals in real-time.

🟢 Green pins = Terminals online, no alerts
⚪ Gray pins = Terminals offline, no alerts
🟡 Yellow pins = User-Initiated alerts (manual trigger)
🔴 Red pins = Critical alerts (sensor-triggered emergencies)
How it works:

Pins update instantly via WebSocket when alerts are triggered
No need to refresh - changes appear in real-time
Each pin represents a terminal location with focal person details
2. Live Report Sidebar - Unassigned Tab
As a dispatcher, I want to see all unassigned alerts so I can prioritize rescue operations.

Location: Right sidebar → "Unassigned" tab

Displays:

All Critical and User-Initiated alerts
Alerts with status = "ONLINE" (active, not yet assigned)
Shows: Terminal name, alert type, focal person, address, contact number
Action: Click on any alert card to view details

3. Signal Popover - View Alert Details
As a dispatcher, I want to click on an alert to see full details and take action.

What appears:

Terminal ID & Name
Alert Type (Critical/User-Initiated)

Option B: 🚨 Dispatch Rescue

Removes alert from Live Report Sidebar
Creates a new entry in Reports → Pending Tab
Rescue operation is now active
5. Waitlisted Tab - Pending Resources
As a dispatcher, I want to manage alerts that are waiting for available rescue teams.

Location: Right sidebar → "Waitlisted" tab

Displays:

Alerts marked as "Waitlisted" from the rescue form
