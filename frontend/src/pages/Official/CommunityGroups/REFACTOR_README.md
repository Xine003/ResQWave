## 🏗️ Architecture

### Global State Store Pattern
- **`formStore.ts`**: Global JavaScript store that persists form data across navigation
- **`useFormStore.ts`**: React hook that connects components to the global store
- **No complex session management**: Data persists in memory during navigation

### Key Benefits
- ✅ **Form data persists** when navigating to location picker
- ✅ **Photos remain uploaded** across navigation  
- ✅ **Simple state management** with global store
- ✅ **No serialization issues** with File objects
- ✅ **Clean separation of concerns**

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. User fills form → Data stored in global store
2. User navigates to location picker → Component unmounts but store persists
3. User returns → Component remounts and connects to same store
4. All data including photos are still available

## 🚀 Usage

The main component is now `CreateCommunityGroupSheet` which uses the global store pattern for reliable form persistence across navigation.

## 🏗️ Core Components

### 1. CreateCommunityGroupSheet.tsx
**Purpose**: Main form component for creating/editing community groups
**Key Features**:
- Global form state management
- Photo upload with preview
- Location picker integration
- Form validation
- Edit mode support

**Props**:
```typescript
interface CommunityGroupDrawerProps {
  open: boolean
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void
  onSave?: (infoData: CommunityGroupDetails) => void
  editData?: CommunityGroupDetails
  isEditing?: boolean
}
```

### 2. CommunityGroupInfoSheet.tsx
**Purpose**: Display detailed community group information
**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive community data display
- Photo viewer with zoom functionality
- Focal person information
- Community statistics

### 3. CommunityGroupApprovalSheet.tsx
**Purpose**: Handle approval workflow for pending community groups
**Key Features**:
- Review pending applications
- Approve/reject functionality
- Terminal assignment integration
- Complete application details

### 4. PhotoUploadArea.tsx
**Purpose**: Handle photo uploads for focal persons
**Key Features**:
- Drag & drop file upload
- Image preview
- File validation (type, size)
- Replace/delete functionality

**Props**:
```typescript
interface PhotoUploadAreaProps {
  inputId: string
  photo: File | null
  onDelete: () => void
  onFileSelect: (file: File) => void
  photoUrlKey: "focalPersonPhoto" | "altFocalPersonPhoto"
  photoUrls: PhotoUrls
}
```

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Fixed Auto-Opening Issue**
- **Problem**: Create neighborhood sheet was automatically opening on page load
- **Solution**: 
  - Properly clear sessionStorage flags after use
  - Remove window focus event listeners that caused unwanted reopening
  - Clear flags when drawer is intentionally closed

### 2. **Enhanced Form Validation**
- Email validation for focal person contacts
- Phone number validation (11-digit Philippine format)
- Required field validation
- Real-time error display

### 3. **Improved State Management**
- Global form store prevents data loss during navigation
- Proper cleanup of sessionStorage flags
- Better edit mode handling
- Form persistence for location picker workflow

### 4. **Better Data Structure**
- Comprehensive community group details
- Proper TypeScript typing
- Structured focal person information
- Geographic coordinate support

## 🔧 Location Setting Integration

The system includes a sophisticated location picker:
- **SettingLocationPage.tsx**: Full-screen map interface
- **SettingLocationControls.tsx**: Map controls and tools
- **SettingLocationAlerts.tsx**: User guidance and alerts

Location workflow:
1. User clicks "Set Location" in form
2. Navigates to map page
3. Selects coordinates
4. Returns to form with location data preserved

## 🐛 Recent Bug Fixes

1. **✅ Auto-opening drawer issue**: Fixed sessionStorage flag management
2. **✅ Form validation**: Added comprehensive field validation
3. **✅ Data persistence**: Improved form state management
4. **✅ Photo handling**: Better file upload and preview
5. **✅ Edit mode**: Proper form pre-population

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Authentication Testing
1. Test login with both mock accounts (`COMGROUP-01`, `COMGROUP-02`)
2. Verify role-based permissions
3. Test session persistence

### Community Groups Testing
1. **Creation Flow**: Test complete form filling and submission
2. **Location Setting**: Test navigation to/from location picker
3. **Photo Upload**: Test image upload, preview, and replacement
4. **Edit Mode**: Test editing existing community groups
5. **Approval Workflow**: Test admin approval of pending groups

### Data Validation Testing
1. Test all form field validations
2. Test email format validation
3. Test phone number format validation
4. Test required field enforcement

## 📝 Console Logging

All components include comprehensive logging with emoji indicators:
- 🏗️ Component renders
- 📸 Photo operations
- 💾 Data persistence
- 🔄 State changes
- ✅ Success operations
- ❌ Error conditions
- 🔍 Form data updates
- 📍 Location operations

##  Key Improvements

### 1. **Code Organization**
- **Before**: Single 1198-line component with everything mixed together
- **After**: 5 focused components + 1 custom hook, each under 200 lines

### 2. **State Management**
- **Before**: Multiple competing useEffects causing infinite loops
- **After**: Single initialization effect with proper dependency management

### 3. **Data Persistence**
- **Before**: Complex session management with race conditions
- **After**: Dedicated hook with proper serialization/deserialization

### 4. **Image Handling**
- **Before**: Base64 strings causing display issues
- **After**: Proper blob URLs with memory cleanup

### 5. **Type Safety**
- **Before**: Loose typing with potential runtime errors
- **After**: Strong TypeScript interfaces throughout

## � Recent Bug Fixes

1. **✅ Maximum update depth exceeded**: Fixed competing useEffect loops
2. **✅ Data loss on navigation**: Proper session persistence
3. **✅ Images not displaying**: Correct blob URL handling
4. **✅ Edit mode issues**: Proper initialization and state management

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

- **Memory Management**: Proper blob URL cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Debounced Saves**: Auto-save with 500ms debounce reduces storage calls
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Better dependency arrays prevent unnecessary updates
- **Component Splitting**: Smaller components enable better tree shaking

## 📝 Console Logging

All components include comprehensive logging with emoji indicators:
- 🏗️ Component renders
- 📸 Photo operations
- 💾 Data persistence
- 🔄 State changes
- ✅ Success operations
- ❌ Error conditions

## 🧪 Testing Considerations

1. **Form Persistence**: Test navigation away and back to form
2. **Photo Handling**: Test upload, replace, delete operations
3. **Edit Mode**: Test pre-filling and persistence
4. **Validation**: Test file type/size validation
5. **Session Management**: Test session restoration and cleanup
